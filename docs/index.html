        <h1>Automated Assessment of Inland Flooding from Satellite Observations</h1>
        <p>This project focuses on developing an algorithm for automated assessment of inland flooding from satellite observations. Specifically, this algorithm collects satellite images corresponding to before-, during-, and after-flood events and applies the K-means clustering technique to identify flooded areas. The ultimate goal is to enhance flood detection capabilities, providing insights that can be applied to flood detection using drone measurements.</p>
        <p>While the project initially targeted Maine, it has been expanded to include the New England Region with similar flood characteristics.</p>
